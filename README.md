# Git & Github 
## Git
Git is a version control system that allows developers to keep track of changes to their code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the same person who created Linux, and it's now widely used by developers around the world.

The idea behind Git is simple. Instead of making a copy of your code each time you want to make a change, Git allows you to create a "snapshot" of your code at any point in time. These snapshots are called "commits", and they contain all the changes you've made since the last commit.

One of the great things about Git is that it allows you to easily collaborate with other developers. You can share your code with others by creating a "repository", or "repo" for short, which is a place where your code and all its history are stored. Others can then "clone" your repo to make a copy of it on their own computer and make changes to the code. Once they're done, they can push their changes back to the original repo, and you can review and merge their changes into your code.

## Github

Github is a web-based platform that serves as a hub for software development projects. It allows developers to collaborate on code by hosting and sharing repositories. A repository, or "repo" for short, is essentially a folder that contains all the files and code for a particular project.

Github provides a number of features to help developers work together on these repos. One of the most important is version control. Version control allows developers to keep track of changes to code over time, so they can easily see who made what changes and when. Github also allows developers to "fork" repos, which means making a copy of the repo to work on independently. Once the changes are made, the developer can submit a "pull request" to the original repo owner to merge the changes.

Github also has a number of tools to help developers manage issues and bugs. Developers can use Github to track issues and assign them to team members for resolution. This helps ensure that everyone is on the same page and working together to address any problems that arise.

Finally, Github is a great platform for showcasing your work to the broader community. You can make your repos public, which means anyone can see them and contribute to them. This is a great way to get feedback on your code and to connect with other developers who share your interests.

Overall, Github is a powerful tool that plays a central role in modern software development. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, it's definitely worth learning more about!

## Commonly Used Git commands
`git init` - This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. You'll want to use this command whenever you're starting a new project and want to use Git to manage your code.
```
git init
```

`git add` - This command adds changes to the staging area, which is where Git tracks changes before committing them to the repository. You'll want to use this command to add any changes you've made to your code that you want to include in your next commit.
```
git add
```

`git commit` - This command creates a new commit in your Git repository. Each commit represents a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time. You'll want to use this command to save your changes to the repository, along with a message describing what changes you made.
```
git commit
```

`git push` - This command pushes your local changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on Github. You'll want to use this command to share your changes with others and keep your local repository in sync with the remote repository.
```
git push
```

`git pull` - This command pulls changes from a remote repository to your local repository. You'll want to use this command to update your local repository with changes made by others, so you have the most up-to-date version of the code.
```
git pull
```

`git status` - This command shows the current state of your Git repository, including any changes that have been made and whether they've been staged for commit. You'll want to use this command frequently to keep track of the changes you're making to your code and make sure everything is in order before committing.
```
git status
```

`git log` - This command shows a history of commits in your Git repository. You'll want to use this command to see a list of all the changes that have been made to your code, along with who made them and when.
```
git log
```
